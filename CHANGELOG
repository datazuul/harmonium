Version 0.7 (20 Dec 2009)
-------------------------
* Use jmdns 1.0 rather than the jmdns code in hme.jar, which resolves an
  issue where Harmonium would periodically disappear from the Tivo.
* Pressing <ENTER> now adds the selected item to a playlist, not the
  selected item's parent.
* Added most of the source from hme.jar, allowing me to fix the
  HeadlessException thrown when running on a Linux machine that's not
  logged in (or lacking X entirely).
* Added artist name to browse playlist screen.
* Pressing <PLAY> on a disc now plays just that disc.
* Updated README with current information.
* Updated to the latest version of Java Service Wrapper.
* Default wrapper.conf changes:
    * Passing java.net.preferIPv4Stack=true to java commandline to work 
      on OSes with ipv6 enabled.
    * Removed -debug from java commandline
    * Changed min/max java heap to 32/256.
    * Minor log size/splitting changes.

Version 0.6 (6 Sep 2009)
------------------------
* Implemented Tivo resource management.  The out of memory errors should no 
  longer occur.  Harmonium should also no longer slow down the longer you run 
  it.
* Browse music by album artist, track artist, or track name.
* Re-arranged items on the main screen a bit.  "Now Playing" only appears when
  music is playing.
* On long lists, you can use the number keys to jump by 10% increments in the 
  list.  Pressing 5 takes you to the midpoint in the list.  Pressing 7 takes 
  you 70% of the way to the bottom.  0 toggles between the top and bottom of 
  the list.
* There's a configurable screen blanker.  It defaults to 5 minutes.
* You can play a list of music starting with the current track.  Like an iPod,
  when you press play on the 5th song of an album, you start playing the whole
  album, starting with the 5th song.
* You can browse playlists.  You can start playback at a particular track.
* Info button from anywhere takes you to now playing, if music is playing.
* After 20 seconds of inactivity, if music is playing, the Now Playing screen
  is displayed.
* "Now Playing" playlist:
    * When there's music playing, there's a "Now Playing" playlist.
    * Like any other playlist, you can browse it and jump to any track.
    * Browse it via the "Browse Playlists" screen while music is playing.
    * Browse it by pressing "Info" while on Now Playing.  (So pressing "Info"
      twice from anywhere will get you there.)
    * You can add tracks to play next or add them at the end without stopping
      playback.  Cool for parties.
* "Back" (channel down button) while playing a track goes to the beginning of
  the track if more than 2 seconds have elapsed in the song (like an iPod or 
  CD player).
* Time in current song updates on now playing screen.
* Play button from lots of screens does what you'd expect.
* Lists are no longer case sensitive.
* If an album has "Disc XX" or "CD XX" at the end of it, it gets removed. 
  (Only for display.  The mp3 file isn't altered.)  You have to delete
  Harmonium's cache file and restart to see this.
* Some modest performance improvements when building music cache.
* Modest performance improvements fetching album art.
* Fixed current playlist consistency when toggling shuffle on/off.
* Added button sound effects where they were missing.
* Fixed/suppressed a bunch of compiler warnings in the blinkenlights library 
  and included that with source.


Version 0.5.1 BETA (10 Sep 2008)
--------------------------------
* Reverted to version 1.4 of HME SDK because of several bugs encountered
  (album art failed to load, Factory hung on server). This change required
  that the Bananas library be reverted to version 1.3, and that the use of
  Bananas-Plus be discontinued (it depends on HME SDK 1.4.1e and Bananas 
  1.3.1e) in favor of HME-HD.


Version 0.5 BETA (30 Aug 2008)
------------------------------
* Upgrade components to HME 1.4.1e, and BananasPlus. This improves the visual 
  style of standard definition, and adds some advanced components.

* Remove splash screen

* Fix bug affecting simulator. Reported in: 
  http://harmonium.dazeend.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=18

* Extend album info elements on Now Playing Screen to allow for longer strings

* Remove interstitial screens when browsing. Make SELECT and RIGHT do the same 
  thing, namely browse.

* From browse screens, make ENTER key add to playlist. Add note below list to
  prompt user.

* Have Screen Saver ignore VOLUME_UP, VOLUME_DOWN, and MUTE key presses.

* Have Screen Saver pop when playlist ends, so that leaving screen saver can't
  take you to Now Playing Screen when no music is playing.

* In browse screens, jump by letter using ADVANCE/REPLAY keys.

* Have SELECT from Edit Playlist screen take user to a Track Info Screen with
  album art and track details. (This will make sure that user knows what track
  is highlighted even when title is cut off in list.)

* Fix ScreenSaverScreen so that it is all black, even when letterboxing is set
  to gray.

Version 0.4.3 BETA (11 Aug 2008)
--------------------------------
* Correct class path in MANIFEST.MF, so that platform independent installation
  would start correctly.
  
* Replaced background MPEGs with versions that meet TiVo specifications. (Fixes
  flickering background problem on some televisions.)


Version 0.4.2 BETA (10 Aug 2008)
--------------------------------
* Prevent music collection from being erroneously flagged as out of date
  immediately after being built. (Re-set cache timestamp when writing
  cache.)
  
* Catch errors and exceptions in Factory init.


Version 0.4.1 BETA (09 Aug 2008)
--------------------------------
* Limited release

* Add debugging messages


Version 0.4 BETA (07 Aug 2008)
------------------------------
* Check if file exists on disk before playing it.

* Put version on splash screen.

* Permitted non-standard MIME type of "image/jpg" for album art. (This is a 
  workaround for broken ID3 taggers.)
  
* Cache the music collection for faster start up.


Version 0.3.1 BETA (29 Jul 2008)
--------------------------------
Bug Fix:     Fixed backgrounds of Now Playing Screen. Displayed wrong images
             for different formats under simulator/TiVo.

Version 0.3 BETA (29 Jul 2008)
------------------------------
Bug Fix:     Allow empty HPL playlists to be loaded into the music collection.

Cosmetic:    Play bonk sound on playing empty playlist.

Cosmetic:    Put version string on About screen.

New Feature: Compile for Java 5.0.

Bug Fix:     Ignore invalid ID3 header frames.

Bug Fix:     Strip whitespace from tags to avoid duplicates entries.

Bug Fix:     Have MP3's ignore disc tags that are equal to "1/1" so that no
             disc object is created for the track.

Bug Fix:     Fix album info spacing on NowPlayingScreen on 480i screens so it 
             is legible.

Bug Fix:     Rename up_down_*.png to names that match backgrounds.

Bug Fix:     Prevent end of playlist from doing a pop() screen if not on 
             NowPlayingScreen.

New Feature: Refresh music collection on app start. Newly added tracks and
             playlists should appear in music collection without restarting
             the server (Factory). Similarly, deleted tracks and playlists
             should be removed from the music collection.

New Feature: Display splash screen on app start until music collection has
             been refreshed. (So that user doesn't stare at blank screen
             for several seconds.)

Bug Fix:     Make screen blanking work when Now Playing Screen is showing.

New Feature: Make PLAY button work for "Play Entire Music Collection" on
             main menu.

             at startup.
