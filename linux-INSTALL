Linux Daemon Installation
-------------------------
This distribution of Harmonium installs Harmonium as a daemon on a computer
running Linux. Installing Harmonium as a daemon will cause the computer to
start Harmonium automatically each time it is booted.

TiVo Requirements
-----------------
    * A network enabled Series 2, Series 3, or HD TiVo.

      Note
          Configuring your TiVo to connect to your network is beyond the scope
          of these instructions. For help see the TiVo website:
          http://www.tivo.com/mytivo/howto/getconnected/howto_connect_dvr_internet.html 

    * The TiVo must be enabled for Home Network Applications. To do this,
      perform the following:
         1. From TiVo Central, go to Music, Photos, & More.
         2. Select Enable Home Network Applications...
         3. Press THUMBS UP three times, then press ENTER to enable local HME
            applications.
         4. Return to TiVo Central, then Music, Photos, & More. The option
            should now appear as Disable Home Network Applications...

Server Requirements

    * Processor: x86 CPU (Intel Pentium, Celeron, Xeon, etc.; 
      AMD Athlon, etc.)

    * Operating System: any LSB compliant distribution of Linux. (Debian,
      Ubuntu, Red Hat, Fedora, Slackware, etc.)

    * Java runtime evironment version 6 or later.

      Tested
          Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_16-b01)

    * Connected to same network as TiVo.

      Note
          The server's networking subsystem must be initialized before starting
          Harmonium. In particular, the server's network interface must have an
          IP address assigned before Harmonium is started. This might be an
          issue if your computer uses Gnome Network Manager to manage your
          computer's network interface. 

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

      Pre-Installation
      ----------------
   1. Identify the path to the music root directory. All music files must be in
      the music root or one of its subdirectories.

      Note
          In our example below, we assume that the music root is:
          /home/userid/music 

   2. Identify the path to the playlist root directory. All playlist files must
      be in the playlist root or one of its subdirectories.

      Note
          In our example below, we assume that the playlist root is:
          /home/userid/playlists 

      Installation
      ------------
   3. Copy the installation file to your chosen installation location, and then
      uncompress and untar it.

      Example
          $ sudo mv harmonium.tar.gz /usr/local
          $ cd /usr/local
          $ sudo tar zxvf harmonium.tar.gz

   4. In the conf directory under the Harmonium installation directory, find
      and open the file called wrapper.conf using a text editor.

      Example
          $ sudo nano /usr/local/Harmonium/conf/wrapper.conf 

   5. Find the line in wrapper.conf that reads: 
      wrapper.app.parameter.4="/home/your/path/to/music"
      Modify the line so that the path to your music root appears inside the 
      quotation marks.

      Example
          wrapper.app.parameter.4="/home/userid/music"

   6. Find the line in wrapper.conf that reads:
      wrapper.app.parameter.6="/home/your/path/to/playlists"
      Modify the line so that the path to your playlist root appears inside
      the quotation marks.

      Example
          wrapper.app.parameter.6="/home/userid/playlists"

   7. Save the wrapper.conf file, and exit the text editor.

   8. Change directories to the /etc/init.d directory and create a symbolic 
      link that points to script called harmonium in the bin directory under
      the Harmonium installation directory.

      Note
          You must use a symbolic link. Do not copy the script into
          /etc/init.d.

      Example
          $ cd /etc/init.d
          $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/Harmonium/bin/harmonium harmonium 

   9. Test Harmonium by running /etc/init.d/harmonium in console mode. Check
      that Harmonium appears on your TiVo under "Music, Programs, and More." If
      there seems to be a problem, check the log file in the logs directory
      under the Harmonium installation directory. After testing, close
      Harmonium by using the keystroke Ctrl-C.

      Example
          $ sudo /etc/init.d/harmonium console

  10. If everything seems to be working, install Harmonium as a daemon. The
      process of installing a new daemon differs depending on the distribution
      of Linux that is being used.
          
            Debian and Debian derivitives (Ubuntu, etc.)
            --------------------------------------------
            Use the update-rc.d command to install Harmonium as a daemon 
            that starts at boot time.

            Example
                $ sudo update-rc.d harmonium defaults 99 

          
            Red Hat and Red Hat derivitives (Fedora, CentOS, etc.)
            ------------------------------------------------------
            Use the chkconfig command to install Harmonium as a daemon that 
            starts at boot time.

            Example
                $ sudo chkconfig --level 35 harmonium on 

            Note
                When Harmonium first starts, it reads and catalogs the music 
                files that it finds under your music root. This process may 
                take several minutes. (A sample collection of 3500 music files 
                takes 20 minutes to complete.) Until this process has
                completed, Harmonium will not appear on your TiVo. 

  11. Start the daemon. Harmonium should restart automatically the next time 
      the computer is rebooted.

      Example
          $ sudo /etc/init.d/harmonium start
