Linux Daemon Installation Upgrade
---------------------------------
These instructions document how to upgrade an existing installation of
Haromonium running as a Linux daemon. If you do not yet have Harmonium
installed, please refer to the installation instructions.

TiVo Requirements
-----------------
    * A network enabled Series 2, Series 3, or HD TiVo.

      Note
          Configuring your TiVo to connect to your network is beyond
          the scope of these instructions. For help see the TiVo website. 

    * The TiVo must be enabled for Home Network Applications. To do this,
      perform the following:
         1. From TiVo Central, go to Music, Photos, & More.
         2. Select Enable Home Network Applications...
         3. Press THUMBS UP three times, then press ENTER to enable local HME
            applications.
         4. Return to TiVo Central, then Music, Photos, & More. The option
            should now appear as Disable Home Network Applications...

Server Requirements

    * Processor: x86 CPU (Intel Pentium, Celeron, Xeon, etc.; 
      AMD Athlon, etc.)

    * Operating System: any LSB compliant distribution of Linux. (Debian,
      Ubuntu, Red Hat, Fedora, Slackware, etc.)

    * Java runtime evironment version 6 or later.

      Tested
          Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_16-b01)

    * Connected to same network as TiVo.

      Note
          The server's networking subsystem must be initialized before starting
          Harmonium. In particular, the server's network interface must have an
          IP address assigned before Harmonium is started. This might be an
          issue if your computer uses Gnome Network Manager to manage your
          computer's network interface. 

Upgrade Instructions
--------------------
   1. Uncompress the installation file to a temporary location.

      Example
          $ cp harmonium.tar.gz /home/userid
          $ cd /home/userid
          $ tar zxvf harmonium.tar.gz

   2. Stop the Harmonium daemon.

      Example
          $ sudo /etc/init.d/harmonium stop 

   3. Copy the new Harmonium.jar file to the installation directory.

      Example
          $ sudo cp /home/userid/Harmonium/Harmonium.jar /usr/local/Harmonium 

   4. Delete all JAR files from the lib directory within the Harmonium 
      installation directory.

      Example
          $ sudo rm /usr/local/Harmonium/lib/*.jar 

   5. Copy new JAR files to the lib directory within the Harmonium installation
      directory.

      Example
          $ sudo cp /home/userid/Harmonium/lib/*.jar /usr/local/Harmonium/lib 

   6. Copy new wrapper.conf file to the conf directory within the Harmonium
      installation directory.
      
      Example
         $ sudo cp /home/userid/Harmonium/conf/wrapper.conf /usr/local/Harmonium/conf
         
   7. Reconfigure wrapper.conf as described in INSTALL

   8. Restart the Harmonium service.

      Example
          $ sudo /etc/init.d/harmonium start
